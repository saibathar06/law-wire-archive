Simplifying the Concept of Mediation: 
According to ''Black law dictionary'' Mediation  can be referred as procedure or a method for establishing a non-enforceable dispute redressal mechanism with the aid and assistance of an impartial third party, Who not merely help the either parties to arrive at certain negotiable settlement but most importantly assist in overcoming from personal or professional differences between the parties. 
In the more simpler manner Mediation can be defined as  a voluntary process of dispute resolution, where an strange but an expert third person is appointed to redress the dispute  between the opposing party amicably. However, as the process is voluntary so no party is forced to accept the negotiation arrived by the process of mediation. 
Historical Evolution of Mediation in Ancient Indian Society: 
Mull''s  in his " Commentary on Hindu Law"  explores that approximately 4000-1000 B.C  that Indian civilization invoked the unwritten law of divine wisdom, reason and prudence. Those were one of the first originating theories of Mediation which are based on  principles of reason, wisdom &  prudence which are still prevalent and practiced by many western countries  Vedic Society in itself established many dispute redressal assemblies namely. Puga, Kula & Sreni to resolve disputes pertaining to civil & commercial nature. 
''Puga''  was the local board representing all members of all communities & tribes. Likewise, ''Kula'' is the dispute redressal body comprising of all extending family members or caste groups.  Moreover, ''Sreni'' were guilds or groups of artisans & traders having authority to resolve dispute arising out of trade & commerce engagements. These  conventional assemblies together with ''Village Panchayat'' provide even more stable & credible dispute redressal forum then the modern day constitutionally established courts. 
Furthermore, the Ancient treatise like ''Dharam shastra''s'' by providing the reference to scholarly assemblies like ''Parishads'' deepened India''s ancient society role in originating the ''Mediation.'' Further, with the  development of  Buddhist philosophy articulating the relevance of settling differences peacefully.  
Origin and Development of Modern Day Mediation :-
Mediation in the present time trace it history from its emergence in USA in 1960s which was initiated in response to overcome integration and racial issues, where neighbourhood justice shape into the community mediation. Moreover, it significant augment with the advent of private mediation in 1980s where many USA based insurance companies realizes the importance of resolving dispute informally & expeditiously.  However, this development not stops here  but  ensure the simultaneous development of community mediation, private mediation, and court-annexed mediation continue  to meet the needs of disputing parties in the United States.

Furthermore, Pound Convention, 1976 bought turning point in further advancing the outside court settlement in USA. In this conference huge number of  Jurist''s and lawyers participated and deliberated on the serious issues the justice delivery system were facing at that time including delay ''s in trial, overcrowding of the Jails & increase in the litigation cost.  Therefore, legal luminaries in the conference felt the need for alternation litigation options thus establishing a unique concept of  "Multi Door Court Houses."  This concept allows the aggrieved party to simply approach the court and voluntarily plead for the resolution of the disputes through any alternative dispute settlement. Thus, helping the parties to receive the most satisfactory results.  

Recognizing Mediation in India: 
The concept of "Mediation" in modern India got first instance of its legal recognition through the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947. This "Act'' under Section 4 provided the comprehensive procedure for the mediation starting from the appointment of  "conciliators"  and ending  by providing the negotiable settlement satisfying the interest of both the disputed parties. 

The second most important step in recognizing the Mediation in present day India was the enactment of Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 which provided the elaborative provision pertaining to the redressal of the disputes by the appointment of the '' Conciliators'' in a transparent manner. The ''Act'' ensures that the role of the conciliator must not be restricted to assisting parties deliberation by actually helping to reach at certain negotiable settlement. 
The other significant step which shapes the concept of mediation in India was the amendment of Civil Procedure Code, 1908  through " CPC Amendment Act,1999"  which inserted section 89 in the CPC, 1908  which validate the process of mediation in the pending ADR case. However, this amendment was only come into effect from 1st July, 2002. 

The last decade of the 20th century  not only brought the economic liberalization but importantly initiation of India''s acceptance of liberalized law inspiring the welfare law throughout the world. In the year 1995-96  the Supreme Court under the leadership of former CJI Mr. M.A. Ahmadi with the collaboration with the U.S.A  as Indo- US  Joint study on the problem of delays & backlogs in the  India''s Civil justice delivery system. The study strongly suggested the need of amendment in CPC, 1908 and add special reference of inculcating ADR in settling several civil matters. 

 Enactment of Mediation Act, 2023
Although, Section 89 of the CPC Amendment Act, 1999 and  Part III Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 provide the reference for court referred Mediation but lack in elaborating on the clear rule of enforcement, confidentiality & qualification of the mediators. Thus there is the need of one standalone exhaustive statute to institutionalize the process of  mediation in India. 

To bridge''s these gap Mediation Bill, 2021 was presented in the Rajya Sabha  and afterwords refers to Parliament Standing committee on Personal, Public grievance, Law & Justice for the further consideration. The committee by underscoring the need of enacting the standalone legislation to legitimize the mediation also advocate that voluntarily and mandatorily reference to mediation in pre-litigation matters. After incorporating several recommendation''s the Parliament passed the Bill on August 2023. Further come into force after presidential assent on 15th September 2023. 

Salient Feature of Mediation Act, 2023:
This blog doesn''t aims to provide the elaborative study on the Mediation Act, 2023 ( dealing in the next series of Blog) but to provide the reference of some important changes bought through the Act. 
Following are the important changes inculcated under Mediation Act, 2023:-
i.	The ''Act'' broader down the scope of definition of the ''Mediation''  to include pre-litigation, online community mediation under the purview of the mediation aligning the term with the international practices. 
ii.	The ''Act'' explicitly excluded several cases to be decided through the mediation procedure, that includes the case involving minors, serious criminal charges, tax mattes etc. 
iii.	The ''Act'' establish transparency and timely redressal of the dispute by mandating the settling of the dispute within 120 days from the date of initiation of the proceedings. The maximum extension can be granted is of 60 days which is also subjected to the mutual consent of the disputed parties. 
iv.	The ''Act'' provided three ground for challenging the Mediation Settlement Agreement (MSA) i.e. Fraud, corruption & impersonation which also included if any matter decided fall under the excluded category. Any MSA can be challenged based on any of the above grounds within 90 day i.e. subjected to further court-granted extensions. 
v.	The ''Act'' strongly protects the ''confidentiality'' by mandating that no communication throughout the mediation including proposal, admission & recordings can be disclosed or used in the court provided that misconduct of either parties or to enforce the agreement between the parties. 

Concluding Remarks: 
 
 President Abraham Lincon rightly pointed out  that " Discourage litigation, persuade your neighbours to compromise wherever you can, Point out to them how nominal winner is often a real loser- in fees, expenses and waste of time. As the peacemaker the lawyer has the superior opportunity of being a good man. There will be still the business enough." If  the legal luminaries in the contemporary time develops such thinking then the that day is not far when our Court can be able to overcome from the huge backlog of the pending civil cases amicably satisfying the interest of both the parties justifying the ultimate aim of justice delivery institutions.',
